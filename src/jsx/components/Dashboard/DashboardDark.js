				Bear in mind that the Registered Accounts notifies the will smart contract that 
				tokens can be transfered at Stage 3 from the account to the smart contract
				Until stage 3 we can use those accounts as we like.
				For each account we need to Approve and Register the tokens we want to be elgible for 
				the smart contract to transfer at stage 3. In this example we have used ACA and AUSD

				State the trigger point intervals 
				For example for dt1=10, dt2=10, dt3=10, LastCall=10 the following will occur
				As soon the user clicks Initate the Will is signed and Active at block number X e.g. 100
				At block number 110 if the smart contract has not received Proof of life then it will move to Stage 1
				At block number 120 if the smart contract has not received Proof of life then it will move to Stage 2
				At block number 130 if the smart contract has not received Proof of life then it will move to Stage 3
				   Now all registered tokens for each of the registered account will be transfered to the smart contract
				   If the will administrator is still alive and cliks Void button he cancels the Will and deposited funds are returned to the registered accounts that have been transfered from 
				At block number 140 if the smart contract has not received Proof of life then it will move to Stage 4
				   This is the point of no return. All tokens deposited to the smart contract (please note tokens deposited as fees ACA and AUSD are kept separate to maintain smart contract operation)
				   are swapped for Acala Dollar AUSD.
				At block number 145 (by default 5 blocks later than the swaps) all AUSD is split and transfered out of the smart contract to the beneficiaries as per the seetings established at Register Beneficiaries setup
                (in the future the smart contact will unstake any AUSD staked at Fees step and together with any remaining ACA will be transferred to the beneficiaries evenly)
                (couple of blocks later and the Will Smart contract resets deleting registered accounts of administrator and registered beneficiaries)

				the first 2 lines shows the fees balances of admin adn smart contract and the NONCE of these account 
				(smart contract has the functionality of detecting all administrator's registered accounts for the native ACA balance. If this decreases it means that either the account owner (will administrator)
				has transfer ACA out or has signed a transaction (The button check account exhibits this finctionality but it should only be clicked by an account other than the will adminstrator and his registered accounts only place here for demo))
				The next 4 lines show the balance across all tokens ACA, AUSD, DOT , LDOT, RENBTC for
